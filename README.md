## Requires
* [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)

    - ðŸš§ make a dice roll in simplified [dice notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation): `AdB+M`
        - `A`: number of rolls (can be omitted if 1)
        - `B`: number of sides
        - `M`: a modifier that is added to (or subtracted from) roll result ("+" or "-" between `B` and `M` defines modifier's sign)
    - `A`, `B` and `M` are integer numbers, `A` and `B` are positive.
    - Maximum number of rolls is 100, the biggest allowed dice has 120 sides.

## Planned Features
* `/roll` similar to [RollEm Telegram Bot](https://github.com/treetrnk/rollem-telegram-bot) ðŸš§
    - arbitrary chained rolls (`4+2d6+d10-d7`)
    - exploding rolls (`d6!` or `d10x`), where maximum rolled value triggers extra rolls
